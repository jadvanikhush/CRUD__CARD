# React User Management App

A simple React app that allows users to view a list of users, like/unlike them, edit their details, and remove them from the list. This app uses React for frontend, TailwindCSS for styling, and state management with React hooks (`useState`).

## Features

- **User List**: Displays a list of users with their name, email, phone, and city.
- **Like Button**: Toggle the "like" state for each user. When liked, the heart icon turns blue, and vice versa.
- **Edit User**: Opens a modal to edit the user's details. Edits reflect instantly in the list without API updates.
- **Remove User**: Removes a user from the list.
- **Responsive Layout**: TailwindCSS is used for a responsive and clean UI design.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for designing the layout and styling.
- **React Hooks (`useState`)**: To manage state and handle user interactions.
